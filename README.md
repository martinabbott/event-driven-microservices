# Event Driven Microservices with Azure Functions, Event Grid and Cosmos DB

This repository contains the code delivered as a demonstration during my presentation at a few conferences in 2020, including Microsoft Ignite the Tour Sydney, Global Integration Bootcamp and Integrate 2020 Remote.

The code uses Azure Functions, Event Grid and Cosmos DB to demonstrate event-driven design. The code is nothing more than scaffold, there is no exception handling, failure handling or any logging, auditing, security or tracing that would be built in to a final solution, and as such is offered as is.
